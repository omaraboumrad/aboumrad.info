Summary: Who doesn't love pancakes? The best breakfast, lunch and dinner!
Status: Published
Schema: Article

There's nothing like waking up early in the morning and preparing the simplest and
tastiest breakfast ever! I've always been a fan of pancakes, they used to be a
real treat when I was a child. My father used to make them for dinner. (I know right?)

We still occasionally make batches for ourselves, throw some fruits on top and
drown them with maple syrup!

Though with the kids, we reduce the added sugar as much as possible and opt for
a bucket of fruit salad instead so no maple syrup! We use a bit of orange juice
as the _sauce_ for the salad, which soon after really brings out great flavor
from the fruits.

The part where we struggle the most is keeping the kids away from the fruit
bucket until the pancakes are done!

And while we're on the subject, here's a recent magnificent effort my wife placed
in making a gigantic trifle! Pretty awesome for a first try!

I love me some sweet breakfast with a hot cup of coffee!

Enjoy
